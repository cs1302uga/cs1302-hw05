# cs1302-hw05 Lovable Linked Lists 

![Approved for: Fall 2023](https://img.shields.io/badge/Approved%20for-Fall%202023-green)

This homework assignment explores how to work with nodes commonly used in linked lists. 

## Prerequisite Knowledge

* [CSCI 1302 Reference Variable Refresher](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/refresher/variables.md)

## Course-Specific Learning Outcomes

* **LO1.d:** Use shell commands to compile new and existing software solutions that are organized into 
multi-level packages and have external dependencies.
* **LO7.c:** (Partial) Use common abstract data types and structures, including lists, queues, arrays, 
and stacks in solving typical problems.  Generate user-facing API documentation for a software solution.

## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Odin server. 

**NOTE:** For each step, please provide in your notes the full command that you typed to make the related 
action happen along with an explanation of why that command worked. Some commands require multiple options. 
It is important to not only recall what you typed but also why you typed each of them. If context is necessary 
(e.g., the command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.
You won't need to submit your notes in your final submission. However, if done properly, your exercise notes 
will serve as a helpful study guide for the exam.

## Exercise Steps

### Checkpoint 1 Steps - Getting Started

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Odin into a subdirectory called `cs1302-hw05`:

   ```
   $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-hw05.git
   ```

1. Change into the `cs1302-hw05` directory that was just created and look around.  There should be
   a `lib` directory that contains an external library file, in `.jar` format, containing compiled 
   Java code (`.class`) files as our "starter code" for this homework.
   The library was created by your instructors and will be the same library we give you for your next project (`cs1302-str-list`). 
   You have used an "external library file" before (in project 1). We will also explain it further below:
   
1. What is a JAR file?

   In Java, `.jar` files are Java™ Archive (JAR) files that bundle multiple files into a single compressed file. Think of it sort of like a Zip file
   for compiled Java code (`.class` files). The author of the library has provided you with a way to use the code but not see the source code.
   Typically a JAR file contains the package directories and `.class` files for a library. This is just like the `bin` directory that you are used to, except 
   it's all bundled into a single file. For example, the `cs1302-str-list.jar` file contains the package directories and `.class` files for 
   `cs1302.adt.Node` along with a few other things that we will ignore in this homework assignment.
   
   If you are in the `cs1302-hw05` directory, then you can use the following command to take a peek into the archive:
   
   ```
   $ jar -tf lib/cs1302-str-list.jar
   ```

   The class we are interested in using in this homework is `cs1302.adt.Node`, which is very similar to the `Node` class used in lecture and in
   the [ADT and Links Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/alsi/adt-and-links/adt-and-links.md).

   You should also notice that the top-level directory in the JAR file is `cs1302`, which means that the JAR file itself can serve as the default package 
   for compiled code — this is what we use with `-cp` in the examples of this project description.

1. **Compiling code with a JAR File**

   If code you write depends on a class in a JAR file, you will need to add the JAR file to the classpath. For example, `-cp lib/cs1302-str-list.jar`. 
   If your code has a dependency within the JAR file and another class you wrote, you will need to add both dependencies to the classpath as described in
   the [package tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/alsi/packages2.md#setting-the-class-path).
   
1. For convenience, here is a link to the 
   [`Node` API Documentation](https://webwork.cs.uga.edu/~mepcott/cs1302-str-list/cs1302/adt/Node.html) (may require a VPN connection)
   which includes a UML diagram for the class. If you haven't done so already, take a few minutes to read through the code
   examples given under the UML diagram and take note of the methods available in the `Node` class.

1. Now, consider the following example code snippet:
   
   ```java
   Node example = null;                 // line 1
   example = new Node("Hello");         // line 2
   example.setNext(new Node("World"));  // line 3
   ```
   
   **We can illustrate this snippet by drawing a diagram for the first line**, 
   then **redrawing the entire diagram after subsequent lines.** Here are the 
   three corresponding diagrams, one for each line in the example:
   
   ```
   // after line 1
   example = null
   ```
   
   ```
   // after line 2
                   /----------------\
   example ------->| item -> "Hello"|
                   | next = null    |
                   \----------------/
   ```
   
   ```
   // after line 3
                   /----------------\       /----------------\
   example ------->| item -> "Hello"|   /-->| item -> "World"|
                   | next ----------|--/    | next = null    |
                   \----------------/       \----------------/
   ```
   
1. Create a `Driver` program using the code below but **don't run it yet**. Make sure you place the file in the proper directory within `src`. 
   Before running the code, we want you to trace through it (illustrate it, like we did above) carefully to make sure you understand it. 

   * For _each line_ in **`CODE BLOCK 1`, `CODE BLOCK 2`, and `CODE BLOCK 3`** (only these three blocks for now), draw a diagram that 
     illustrates any nodes that have been created along with their associated `item` and `next` references. 
     Since `next` is a reference, you would either need to denote it as `null` or draw an arrow to 
     the object it references. **Redraw the entire picture after each line.** Here are some things
     to note:
   
        * Although the associated string is also a reference, you may draw it within the node. 
        * Number each step in your notes. There are 7 lines among `CODE BLOCK 1`, `CODE BLOCK 2`, and `CODE BLOCK 3`,
          so we expect 7 steps/diagrams in your notes for this part. 
        * Reference variables that are not contained in node objects (e.g., `a`, `b`, and `c`) 
          should also be included in the diagram.
          
        ```java
        package cs1302.hw05;

        public class Driver {
   
            public static void main(String[] args) {

                // CODE BLOCK 1
                Node a = new Node("Joe");
                a.setItem("Billy");
        
                // CODE BLOCK 2
                new Node("Linda", a);
        
                // CODE BLOCK 3
                Node b = new Node("Juno");
                b.setNext(a);
                a.setNext(new Node("Sally"));
                b.getNext().getNext().setNext(new Node("Barry"));
        
                // CODE BLOCK 4
                Node c = b.getNext().getNext();
                c.getNext().setNext(new Node("Simon"));

                // CODE BLOCK 5
                System.out.println(c.getNext().getNext().getNext());
                System.out.println(b.getItem());
                System.out.println(a.getNext().getNext().getItem());
                System.out.println(c.getNext().getNext().getItem());

                // CODE BLOCK 6
                a.setNext(new Node("Simone"));

                // CODE BLOCK 7
                System.out.println(a.getNext().getNext());
        
            } // main

        } // Driver
        ```

1. For this checkpoint (code blocks 1-3), there is no output. However, we've provided the sample
   solutions for the exercise so far in [CP1.md](CP1.md). Please check your answers closely and
   fix any discrepancies before moving on to the next checkpoint.

### Checkpoint 2 Steps

1. **Please read this entire bullet point, including sub-bullets, before continuing.**
   For _each line_ in **`CODE BLOCK 4`, `CODE BLOCK 5`, `CODE BLOCK 6`, and `CODE BLOCK 7`**, 
   draw a diagram that illustrates any nodes that have been created along with their associated 
   `item` and `next` references. Like before, **redraw the entire picture after each line.** 
   Here are some things to note:
   
   * Number each step in your notes, starting with 8 (which is the first line in `CODE BLOCK 4`).
     There are 8 lines among `CODE BLOCK 4`, `CODE BLOCK 5`, `CODE BLOCK 6`, and `CODE BLOCK 7`,
     so we expect 8 steps in your notes for this part.
   * If a line contains a `println` statement, then you can simply write its output.

1. Before running the application, write the expected output in your notes.

1. Make sure you are in the `cs1302-hw05` directory. In your notes, write the exact command to:
   1. Compile `Driver.java` specifying `bin` as the default package location for your compiled code. You may need
      to import any class(es) that are contained in external packages and add the JAR file to the classpath since
      `Driver` depends on `Node`.

   1. Run `cs1302.hw05.Driver`.

      **NOTE:** This program has dependencies on compiled code in two locations: i) the compiled code you placed into `bin`; and 
      ii) the compiled code in the JAR file. You will need to place the paths to the default package locations for 
      both on the class path in order to run your program. You can accomplish this by using the following option to 
      `java`: `-cp bin:lib/cs1302-str-list.jar`. You may also need to import any classes used from the JAR file.

      
1. Write the output from the program in your notes. If your output for the four lines under `CODE BLOCK 5` 
   and the line under `CODE BLOCK 7` do not match the output from the program execution, then make a note of it, 
   then try to fix your diagrams and output before claiming this checkpoint.
   
1. Add the actual output from running the application to a file called `SUBMISSION.md`. This file should be located
   directly within the `cs1302-hw05` directory. Go ahead and add this output now — the next checkpoint will have you
   change the code, so it's best to save this output now. The expected format of this file can be found below
   under [Submission Steps](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-hw05#submission-steps).

### Checkpoint 3 Steps

1. In `Driver.java`, remove (or comment out) the last two Java instructions (code blocks 6 and 7) from the `main` method. 
   These two lines are:

   ```java
   // CODE BLOCK 6                                                                                                                                               
   a.setNext(new Node("Simone"));

   // CODE BLOCK 7                                                                                                                                               
   System.out.println(a.getNext().getNext());
   ```

1. In `Driver.java`, add a method to print the string value of an arbitrary `Node` starting from
   some specified `Node`. **Below is the signature for the method you should implement,** including
   some Javadoc documentation. You do **NOT** need to explicitly create and `throw` the `NullPointerException`
   mentioned in the comment (it should get thrown automatically under the described condition). 
   
   ```java
   /**
    * Prints the string value for a node. Starting with {@code node}, this method attempts
    * to traverse {@code numLinks}-many {@code getNext()} links, then prints the result of 
    * calling {@code getItem()} on the very last node in its traversal. 
    *
    * @param node      starting node
    * @param numLinks  number of links to traverse
    * @throws NullPointerException when an attempt is made to call {@code getItem()} or
    *         {@code getNext()} using a {@code null} reference.
    */
   public static void printNode(Node node, int numLinks) {
       ...
   } // printNode
   ```
   
1. In your notes, write down the expected output the following lines of code, 
   assuming they're placed in the `main` method after all of the existing lines of code:
   
   ```java
   printNode(a, 1);
   printNode(b, 2);
   printNode(c, 0);
   printNode(a.getNext(), 0);
   printNode(c.getNext(), 3);
   ```

1. At the end of the `main` method of `Driver.java`, add the following lines of code
   if you haven't already. **Do not catch the `NullPointerException` if thrown by any
   of these lines**:
   
   ```java
   printNode(a, 1);
   printNode(b, 2);
   printNode(c, 0);
   printNode(a.getNext(), 0);
   printNode(c.getNext(), 3);
   ```
      
1. Compile and run your `Driver` program and make sure all code in the `src` directory passes the `checkstyle` audit.

1. Write the output from the program in your notes. If your expected output does not match the output from the 
   program execution, indicate the reason(s) in your notes.

1. **NOTE:** You do not need to include the output of this step in your `SUBMISSION.md` file as we will be able to run the program to see the output.

### Submission Steps

**Each student needs to individually submit their own work.**

1. Create a plain text file called `SUBMISSION.md` directly inside the `cs1302-hw05`
   directory with the following information:

   1. Your name and UGA ID number; and
   1. The full output of the application at the end of checkpoint 2 (before the step 3 modifications).
  
   Here is an example of the contents of `SUBMISSION.md`:
   
   ```
   Sally Smith (811-000-999)
   output line 1
   output line 2
   output line 3
   ...
   output line n
   ```

1. Change directories to the parent of `cs1302-hw05` (e.g., `cd ..` from `cs1302-hw05`). If you would like
   to make a backup `.tar` file, the instructions are in the submissions steps for [hw01](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-hw01).
   We won't repeat those steps here and you can view them as optional.
   
1. Use the `submit` command to submit this exercise to `csci-1302`:
   
   ```
   $ submit cs1302-hw05 csci-1302
   ```
   
   Read the output of the submit command very carefully. If there is an error while submitting, then it will displayed 
   in that output. If successful, the submit command creates a new receipt file in the directory you 
   submitted. The receipt file begins with rec and contains a detailed list of all files that were successfully submitted. 
   Look through the contents of the rec file and always remember to keep that file in case there is an issue with your submission.

   **Note:** You must be on Odin to submit.
